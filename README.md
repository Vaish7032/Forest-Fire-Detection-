Forest Fire Detection using Machine Learning

 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Forest Fire Detection System** using **Machine Learning techniques** to analyze environmental factors and predict the likelihood of fire occurrence. Early detection of forest fires is critical to minimize damage, protect ecosystems, and save lives.

The notebook demonstrates how data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training can be combined to build an effective predictive system.

⚙️ Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning for environmental datasets.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
* Implementation of **classification/regression models** for prediction.
* Model evaluation using accuracy and error metrics.
* Insights into the relationship between temperature, humidity, wind, and fire risk.

🛠️ Tech Stack

* Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Platform: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Workflow

1. Import and clean dataset.
